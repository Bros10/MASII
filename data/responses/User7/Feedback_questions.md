Was the tool easy for you to use?
Yeah, I found the tool pretty simple to use, and I got the hang of it quite quickly.

Did the tool effectively identify security issues and vulnerabilities?
It did a decent job of identifying vulnerabilities, but I think it could be improved by detecting more common issues.

Did the tool aid your understanding of the application?
It certainly did help me understand the application better and see how the different components interacted.

Did the tool provide insight into the actions each user-role can perform?
It did offer some insights, but having a single diagram for all user roles instead of multiple outputs would make it easier to follow.

Did the tool save you time during the penetration testing process?
The tool did save me some time, but with more customisation options for output formats, like markdown, it could save even more time when copying results into reporting engines.

Was the tool helpful in organising and presenting information about the website under test?
It was quite helpful, but I think it would be even better if the output was more customisable.

Did you encounter any difficulties or issues while using the tool?
No major issues, just some thoughts on how the tool could be improved in terms of output customisation and detecting common vulnerabilities.

Did the tool detect all expected security issues and vulnerabilities?
It detected many of the expected issues, but I believe it could be improved by adding the detection of more common vulnerabilities.

What additional features or functionalities would you like to see added to the tool in the future?
I'd like to see more customisation options for output formats, such as markdown, and improvements in detecting common issues. A single diagram for all user roles would also be beneficial.

Would you recommend this tool to other penetration testers?
Yeah, I think it's a useful tool, but with the suggested improvements, it could be even better.

Overall, how satisfied were you with the tool and its performance?
I was fairly satisfied with the tool, but I see room for improvement in terms of output customisation and detection capabilities.

Do you have any additional comments or feedback about the tool?
The tool has great potential, and with some refinements in customisation, output formats, and vulnerability detection, it could become an essential resource for penetration testers.
