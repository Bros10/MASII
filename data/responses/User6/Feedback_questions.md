Was the tool easy for you to use?
The tool was relatively straightforward to use, but it took a bit of time to get accustomed to the interface.

Did the tool effectively identify security issues and vulnerabilities?
Yes, it identified several vulnerabilities, but at times it felt like there were too many flags, making it a bit overwhelming.

Did the tool aid your understanding of the application?
To some extent, it did help, but the extensive information made it difficult to focus on the most important aspects.

Did the tool provide insight into the actions each user-role can perform?
It provided some insights, but I felt it could have been more concise and focused on the most relevant actions.

Did the tool save you time during the penetration testing process?
As I was in the control group, my usage of the tool was limited, so I can't fully comment on the time-saving aspect.

Was the tool helpful in organising and presenting information about the website under test?
The tool did organise the information, but the presentation seemed a bit cluttered, making it harder to process quickly.

Did you encounter any difficulties or issues while using the tool?
I found the sheer number of flags slightly overwhelming and would prefer a more streamlined presentation.

Did the tool detect all expected security issues and vulnerabilities?
It detected a good number of issues, but I can't say for certain if it detected all of them, given my limited usage.

What additional features or functionalities would you like to see added to the tool in the future?
I would appreciate a more streamlined interface and the ability to filter or prioritise the findings, making it easier to focus on critical issues.

Would you recommend this tool to other penetration testers?
I believe it could be useful, but improvements in the presentation and filtering capabilities would make it even more valuable.

Overall, how satisfied were you with the tool and its performance?
My satisfaction was moderate, as I see potential in the tool but believe it could be refined further to improve its effectiveness.

Do you have any additional comments or feedback about the tool?
The tool has the potential to be a great asset for penetration testers, but improvements in the interface and a more focused presentation would enhance its value.
